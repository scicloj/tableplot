;; # Building a Composable Graphics API in Clojure, Part 1
;; **A Design Exploration for a plotting API**
;;
;; This is the first post in a series documenting the design and implementation of a new
;; compositional plotting API for Clojure. We're exploring fresh approaches to declarative
;; data visualization, drawing inspiration from Julia's [AlgebraOfGraphics.jl](https://aog.makie.org/stable/)
;; while staying true to Clojure's values of simplicity and composability.
;;
;; Each post in this series combines narrative explanation with executable code — this is a
;; working Clojure notebook that can be used with
;; [Kindly](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly/)-compatible
;; tools like [Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/).
;; Code examples are tested using
;; [Clay's test generation](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/clay_book.test_generation.html).
;; You'll see the API evolve from basic scatter plots through faceting, statistical transforms,
;; and support for multiple rendering backends. By the end, we'll have a complete prototype
;; that handles real-world plotting tasks while maintaining an inspectable design.

;; You may consider the design and implementation here
;; *a draft* for a future library API.
;;
;; ## 📖 A Bit of Context: Tableplot's Journey
;;
;; Before we dive into the technical details, let's talk about where we're coming from.
;;
;; [Tableplot](https://scicloj.github.io/tableplot/) was created in mid-2024 as a pragmatic plotting solution for the
;; [Noj](https://scicloj.github.io/noj/) toolkit—Clojure's growing data science
;; and scientific computing ecosystem. We needed *something* that worked, and we
;; needed it soon. The goal was to add to Noj's offering:
;; a way to visualize data without leaving Clojure or reaching for external tools.
;;
;; Since then, Tableplot's current APIs 
;; ([`scicloj.tableplot.v1.hanami`](https://scicloj.github.io/tableplot/tableplot_book.hanami_walkthrough.html) and
;; [`scicloj.tableplot.v1.plotly`](https://scicloj.github.io/tableplot/tableplot_book.plotly_walkthrough.html)) 
;; have been used in quite a few serious projects.
;;
;; However, we never intended these APIs to be the final word on
;; plotting in Clojure. They were a decent compromise—pragmatic, functional,
;; good enough to be useful. Better designs have been waiting to be explored.
;;
;; ### Learning from Our Users
;;
;; The feedback from Tableplot users has been invaluable. **Thank you** to everyone
;; who took the time to file issues, ask questions, share use cases, and push the
;; library in directions we hadn't anticipated. Your patience with the rough edges
;; and your insights about what works (and what doesn't) have shaped this next iteration.
;;
;; ### The Real-World Data Dev Group
;;
;; This work is also happening in the context of the
;; [Real-World Data dev group](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/real-world-data/),
;; recently reinitiated by Timothy Pratley with new spirit and a stronger focus on
;; open-source collaboration.
;;
;; With that context in mind, let's explore what we're building.

;; # Context & Motivation
;;
;; ## 📖 Why Explore a New Approach?
;;
;; Tableplot currently provides two visualization APIs: `scicloj.tableplot.v1.hanami`
;; for [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) visualizations, and 
;; `scicloj.tableplot.v1.plotly` for [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/).
;; Both have proven useful in real projects, but they've also revealed some constraints
;; that are worth thinking about fresh.
;;
;; The `hanami` API extends the original Hanami library, inheriting its template
;; substitution system with uppercase keywords like `:X` and `:Y`. This brings
;; backwards compatibility requirements that affect both APIs, since `plotly`
;; shares some infrastructure with `hanami`. When you want to change something
;; fundamental, you have to consider the impact across multiple layers.
;;
;; Each API is also tied to a specific rendering target. If you choose `hanami`,
;; you get Vega-Lite—which works for many use cases but has limitations
;; with certain coordinate systems. If you choose `plotly`, you get interactivity
;; but rendering static images programmatically becomes tricky. When you hit a
;; limitation of your chosen rendering target, switching means learning a different API.
;;
;; The intermediate representation between the API and the renderers uses Hanami
;; templates. Template substitution is flexible, but it can be
;; open-ended and difficult to understand when debugging. Error messages sometimes
;; reference template internals rather than your code, and it's not always clear
;; which substitution parameters are valid in which contexts.
;;
;; The APIs also currently expect [tech.ml.dataset](https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset) 
;; datasets. If you have a simple Clojure map or vector, you need to convert it 
;; first—even for simple visualizations.
;;
;; ## 📖 What We're Exploring
;;
;; Some of these limitations will be addressed within the current APIs themselves—
;; we're actively working on improvements. But as we always intended, it's valuable
;; to explore fresh solutions in parallel. A fresh design lets us ask questions
;; that are harder to answer incrementally: Can we design an API where the intermediate
;; representation is plain maps that are easy to inspect and manipulate with standard
;; operations, while working harmoniously with both a functional interface and multiple
;; rendering targets?
;;
;; This notebook prototypes an alternative compositional API to explore these ideas.
;; It's not meant to replace the existing Tableplot APIs—it might become an additional
;; namespace coexisting with `hanami` and `plotly`, or it might inform future design
;; decisions. This is for Tableplot maintainers, contributors, and curious users who
;; want to provide early feedback on the approach.

;;
;; - **📖 Narrative sections** - Explanatory text, context, and design discussions
;; - **⚙️ Implementation sections** - Code that implements features (functions, multimethods, helpers)

;;
;; This convention helps you navigate the document and quickly find what you're looking for:
;; conceptual explanations (📖), working code (⚙️), or usage examples (🧪).

;;
;; This notebook relies on several libraries from the Clojure data science ecosystem.
;; Here's what we use and why:

(ns building-aog-v2
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [* +])
  (:require
   ;; Tablecloth - Dataset manipulation
   [tablecloth.api :as tc]
   [tablecloth.column.api :as col]

   ;; Kindly - Notebook visualization protocol
   [scicloj.kindly.v4.kind :as kind]

   ;; thi.ng/geom-viz - Static SVG visualization
   [thi.ng.geom.viz.core :as viz]
   [thi.ng.geom.svg.core :as svg]

   ;; Fastmath - Statistical computations
   [fastmath.ml.regression :as regr]
   [fastmath.stats :as stats]

   ;; Malli - Schema validation
   [malli.core :as m]
   [malli.error :as me]

   ;; RDatasets - Example datasets
   [scicloj.metamorph.ml.rdatasets :as rdatasets]))

;; [**Tablecloth**](https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/) provides our dataset API, wrapping 
;; [tech.ml.dataset](https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset) with a
;; friendly interface. We use it to manipulate data and access column types.
;;
;; **Key insight**: Tablecloth provides column type information via `tablecloth.column.api/typeof`,
;; which eliminates the need for complex type inference.
;;
;; [**Kindly**](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly-noted/) is the visualization protocol that lets this notebook render
;; plots in different environments ([Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/), [Portal](https://github.com/djblue/portal), etc.). Each rendering target returns
;; a Kindly-wrapped spec.
;;
;; [**thi.ng/geom**](https://github.com/thi-ng/geom) gives us the static SVG target for visualizations that can be saved as images.
;; We specifically use
;; [geom.viz](https://github.com/thi-ng/geom/blob/feature/no-org/org/examples/viz/demos.org) for data visualization.
;;
;; [**Fastmath**](https://github.com/generateme/fastmath) handles our statistical computations, particularly linear
;; regression. It's a comprehensive math library for Clojure.
;;
;; [**RDatasets**](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html) provides classic datasets (penguins, mtcars, iris) for examples.
;; It is made available in Clojure through [metamorph.ml](https://github.com/scicloj/metamorph.ml).

;; # Inspiration: AlgebraOfGraphics.jl
;;
;; This design is inspired by Julia's [AlgebraOfGraphics.jl](https://aog.makie.org/stable/),
;; a visualization library that builds on decades of experience from systems
;; like [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) while introducing clear compositional principles.
;;
;; As the [AoG philosophy](https://aog.makie.org/stable/philosophy) states:

;; > "In a declarative framework, the user needs to express the _question_, and the 
;; > library will take care of creating the visualization."
;;
;; This approach of 
;; ["describing a higher-level 'intent' how your tabular data should be transformed"](https://aog.makie.org/dev/tutorials/intro-i)
;; aligns naturally with Clojure's functional and declarative tendencies—something
;; we've seen in libraries like Hanami, Oz, and others in the ecosystem.
;;
;; We chose AoG because it seemed small enough to grasp and reproduce, while still being
;; reasonably complete in its scope.

;; ## 📖 Glossary: Visualization Terminology
;;
;; Before diving deeper, let's clarify some terms we'll use throughout:
;;
;; **Domain** - The extent of input values from your data. For a column of bill lengths 
;; containing values 32.1, 45.3, and 59.6, the domain extends from 32.1 to 59.6. This is *data space*.
;;
;; **Range** - The extent of output values in the visualization. For an x-axis that spans 
;; from pixel 50 to pixel 550, the range extends from 50 to 550. This is *visual space*.
;;
;; **Scale** - The mapping function from domain to range. A [linear scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(ratio))
;; maps data value 32.1 → pixel 50, and 59.6 → pixel 550, with proportional mapping in between.
;; Other scale types include logarithmic, time, and categorical.
;;
;; **Aesthetic** - A visual property that can encode data. Common aesthetics: `x` position, 
;; `y` position, `color`, `size`, `shape`, `alpha` (opacity). Each aesthetic needs 
;; a scale to map data to visual values.
;;
;; **Mapping** - The connection between a data column and an aesthetic. "Map `:bill-length` 
;; to `x` aesthetic" means "use the bill-length values to determine x positions."
;;
;; **Coordinate System** - The spatial framework for positioning marks. [Cartesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) 
;; (standard x/y grid), [polar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system) (angle/radius), 
;; and [geographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system) (latitude/longitude) 
;; interpret positions differently and affect domain computation.
;;
;; **Statistical Transform** - A computation that derives new data from raw data. Examples: 
;; [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) (fit line), 
;; [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) (bin and count), 
;; [kernel density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) (smooth distribution).
;;
;; **Layer** (in AoG sense) - A composable unit containing data, mappings, visual marks, 
;; and optional transforms. Different from ggplot2's "layer" (which means overlaid visuals).
;;
;; **Rendering Target** - The library that produces final output: thi.ng/geom, 
;; Vega-Lite, or Plotly.

;; ## 📖 Core Insight: Layers + Operations
;;
;; AlgebraOfGraphics.jl treats visualization with two key ideas:
;;
;; **1. Everything is a [layer](https://aog.makie.org/dev/tutorials/intro-i#Layers:-data,-mapping,-visual-and-transformation)**: 
;; Data, mappings, visuals, and transformations all compose the same way
;;
;; - Data sources
;; - Aesthetic mappings (x → column, color → column)
;; - Visual marks (scatter, line, bar)
;; - Statistical transformations (regression, smoothing)
;;
;; *(Note: This is a different notion from "layers" in
;; the [layered grammar of graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html) used by ggplot2 and Vega-Lite,
;; where layers specifically refer to overlaid visual marks. In AoG, "layer" is the fundamental 
;; compositional unit containing data, mappings, visuals, and transformations.)*
;;
;; **2. Two operations**: `*` (product) and `+` (sum)
;;
;; - `*` **merges** layers together (composition)
;;   ```julia
;;   data(penguins) * mapping(:bill_length, :bill_depth) * visual(Scatter)
;;   # → Single layer with all properties combined
;;   ```
;;
;; - `+` **overlays** layers (overlay)
;;   ```julia
;;   visual(Scatter) + visual(Lines)
;;   # → Two separate visual marks on same plot
;;   ```
;;
;; **3. Distributive property**: `a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)`
;;
;;   ```julia
;;   data(penguins) * mapping(:bill_length, :bill_depth) * 
;;       (visual(Scatter) + linear())
;;   # ↓ expands to
;;   (data(penguins) * mapping(:bill_length, :bill_depth) * visual(Scatter)) + 
;;   (data(penguins) * mapping(:bill_length, :bill_depth) * linear())
;;   ```
;;
;; This allows factoring out common properties and applying them to
;; multiple plot types without repetition.

;; ## 📖 Comparison to ggplot2
;;
;; ggplot2 uses `+` for everything:
;; ```r
;; ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + 
;;   geom_point() +
;;   geom_smooth()
;; ```
;;
;; AlgebraOfGraphics separates concerns:
;; ```julia
;; data(df) * mapping(:x, :y) * (visual(Scatter) + smooth())
;; ```
;;
;; **Why two operators?** The separation brings clarity—`*` means "combine properties" 
;; while `+` means "overlay visuals"—and enables composability.

;; ## 📖 Translating to Clojure
;;
;; Julia's approach relies on custom `*` and `+` operators defined on Layer types,
;; using multiple dispatch to handle different type combinations with object-oriented
;; layer representations. This works in Julia's type system.
;;
;; One of our goals here would be bringing this compositional approach while staying
;; true to Clojure idioms: using plain data structures (maps, not objects), enabling
;; standard library operations like `merge`, `assoc`, and `filter`, maintaining the
;; compositional benefits, and making the intermediate representation transparent and
;; inspectable. How do we get the compositional approach of AoG while keeping everything
;; as simple Clojure data?

;; # Design Exploration
;;
;; The core design question: how should we structure layer specifications
;; so they compose naturally with Clojure's standard library?

;; ## 📖 The Problem: Nested Doesn't Merge

(def nested-layer-example
  {:transformation nil
   :data {:bill-length-mm [39.1 39.5 40.3]
          :bill-depth-mm [18.7 17.4 18.0]
          :species [:adelie :adelie :adelie]}
   :positional [:bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm]
   :named {:color :species}
   :attributes {:alpha 0.5}})

;; Standard `merge` doesn't compose nested structures:

(merge {:positional [:x] :named {:color :species}}
       {:positional [:y] :named {:size :body-mass}})
;; Lost `:x` and `:color`.

;; Nested structure requires a custom `merge-layer` function. Not ideal.

;; ## 📖 The Solution: Flat Structure with Namespaced Keys

(def flat-layer-example
  #:aog{:data {:bill-length-mm [39.1 39.5 40.3]
               :bill-depth-mm [18.7 17.4 18.0]
               :species [:adelie :adelie :adelie]}
        :x :bill-length-mm
        :y :bill-depth-mm
        :color :species
        :alpha 0.5
        :plottype :scatter})

;; # 📐 Malli Schemas

;; **Why this works**:
;;
;; - Standard `merge` composes correctly (flat structure)
;; - No collision with data columns (`:aog/plottype` ≠ `:plottype`)
;; - All standard library operations work: `assoc`, `update`, `mapv`, `filter`, `into`
;; - Namespace map syntax `#:aog{...}` keeps things concise

;; # Rendering Targets
;;
;; This API is designed to work with multiple **rendering targets**—the actual
;; visualization libraries that produce the final output. Each target has different
;; strengths:
;;
;; - **`:geom`** ([thi.ng/geom](https://github.com/thi-ng/geom)) - Static SVG, easy to save to files
;; - **`:vl`** ([Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)) - Interactive web visualizations, some coordinate system limitations
;; - **`:plotly`** ([Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/)) - Interactive with 3D support, static export is tricky
;;
;; The idea: you write your plot specification once using our API, and it can be
;; rendered by different targets. This separates **what** you want to visualize from
;; **how** it gets rendered.

;; # The Delegation Strategy
;;
;; A key architectural decision: **What do we compute vs. what do rendering targets handle?**
;;
;; ## 📖 The Core Principle
;;
;; **Statistical transforms require domain computation. Everything else can delegate.**
;;
;; **What are statistical transforms?** These are operations that compute derived data
;; from your raw data points:
;; - **Regression lines** - computing best-fit lines through points ([linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression))
;; - **Smoothing** - [LOESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression) or other smoothing curves
;; - **Histograms** - binning continuous data and counting occurrences ([histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram))
;; - **Density estimation** - [kernel density estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) curves
;;
;; These differ from simple visual mappings (scatter, line) which just render raw data.
;;
;; ### Statistical Transforms Need Domains First
;;
;; Consider [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) computation:
;;
;; ```clojure
;; (* (data penguins) (mapping :bill-length) (histogram))
;; 
;; ```

;; Computation sequence:

;; 1. Must compute domain first (extent from 32.1 to 59.6)
;; 2. Use domain to decide bin edges  
;; 3. Compute bin counts
;; 4. Create bar chart from computed bins
;;
;; **The dependency**: We can't delegate domain to the rendering target because we need it
;; BEFORE we can compute bins. Statistical transforms are an **important part of a
;; plotting library**, so we accept this dependency.
;;
;; **Why compute in our library rather than delegate to rendering targets?** This project is
;; part of a holistic toolkit for data and science. We need visualizations to be consistent
;; with statistical algorithms - when you compute a regression or histogram using Clojure's
;; statistical libraries, the visualization should show exactly the same calculation.
;; Additionally, when working with large datasets, we want to compute statistical summaries
;; in our library (where we have access to the full data) and send only the summarized
;; results to rendering targets. For example, with a million points, we compute the histogram
;; bins and send ~20 bars to Vega-Lite or Plotly, not a million points.
;;
;; ## 📖 What We Compute (Minimal Set)
;; 
;; **1. Statistical Transforms**
;; - Histogram, density, smoothing, regression
;; - Why: Core value, consistency across rendering targets, inspectability
;; 
;; **2. Domain Computation**
;; - Always for :geom target (min/max, then :geom handles "nice numbers")
;; - Only custom domains for :vl and :plotly targets
;; - Why: Required by statistical transforms, :geom needs explicit domains
;; 
;; **3. Type Information**
;; - Use Tablecloth's column types (`col/typeof`)
;; - Fallback inference for plain maps
;; - Why: Free from Tablecloth, needed for transform selection
;; 
;; **4. Theme Colors**
;; - ggplot2 color palette, background, and grid colors
;; - Why: Consistent theming across all rendering targets
;; 
;; ## 📖 What We Delegate (Maximize)
;; 
;; **1. Axis Rendering**
;; - Tick placement, "nice numbers", label formatting
;; - Why: Rendering targets are polished, edge cases are many
;; 
;; **2. Range Computation**
;; - Pixel/visual coordinates
;; - Why: Tightly coupled with layout
;; 
;; **3. Domains for :vl and :plotly (when not customized)**
;; - Rendering targets compute from data we send
;; - Why: Rendering targets already do this well
;; 
;; **4. Scale Merging**
;; - Multi-layer plots: rendering targets handle shared domains
;; - Why: Avoid complex conflict resolution

;; ## 📖 Tablecloth Provides Types
;;
;; We don't need complex type inference. Tablecloth already knows:
;;
;; ```clojure
;; (col/typeof (penguins :bill-length-mm))  ;; => :float64
;; (col/typeof (penguins :species))         ;; => :string
;; ```
;;
;; # Proposed Design
;;
;; ## 📖 API Overview
;;
;; The API consists of three parts:
;;
;; 1. **Constructors** - Build partial layer specifications
;; 2. **Composition operators** - Merge layers (`*`) and overlay them (`+`)
;; 3. **Renderer** - Single `plot` function that interprets layer specs
;;
;; **Current Implementation Status**:
;;
;; - ✅ Core composition (`*`, `+`, layer merging)
;; - ✅ Threading-macro friendly API (`->` works naturally)
;; - ✅ Minimal delegation (compute transforms, delegate rendering)
;; - ✅ Type information from Tablecloth
;; - ✅ Type-aware grouping (categorical color groups, continuous doesn't)
;; - ✅ Explicit `:group` aesthetic for override control
;; - ✅ Three rendering targets (:geom, :vl, :plotly - all with full feature parity)
;; - ✅ Statistical transforms: linear regression, histograms (with grouping support)
;; - ✅ Faceting (row, column, and grid faceting across all targets)
;; - ✅ Custom scale domains
;; - ✅ ggplot2-compatible theming
;; - ✅ Plain Clojure data structures (maps, vectors - no dataset required)
;; - ✅ Malli schemas for layer validation
;; - ✅ Column existence validation with helpful error messages
;;
;; **What's Missing (compared to tableplot.v1.plotly)**:
;;
;; - ⚠️ Plot types: line, bar, box, violin, density, smooth, heatmap, text, segment
;; - ⚠️ Additional aesthetics: size, symbol/shape, opacity, fill, line-width
;; - ⚠️ Statistical transforms: density estimation, smooth (loess/spline), correlation
;; - ⚠️ Coordinate systems: 3D, polar, geo
;; - ⚠️ Advanced layouts: subplots, secondary axes, insets
;; - ⚠️ Interactivity: hover templates, click events, selections
;; - ⚠️ Handling missing data
;;
;; **Design Philosophy Differences**:
;;
;; This API prioritizes composability and algebraic clarity over feature completeness.
;; The focus is on a minimal, well-understood core that can be extended incrementally.
;; Missing features are deferred, not abandoned - they can be added as needed while
;; maintaining the compositional design.

;; ## 📖 How Plots are Displayed
;;
;; Layer specifications returned by `*` and `+` are **automatically displayed as plots**
;; in the notebook. This means you typically don't need to call `plot` explicitly.
;;
;; ```clojure
;; ;; Auto-displays as plot:
;; (-> penguins
;;     (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
;;     (scatter))
;;
;; ;; To inspect the raw layer data, use kind/pprint:
;; (kind/pprint
;;   (-> penguins
;;       (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
;;       (scatter)))
;;
;; ;; To get the target spec (for debugging or customization):
;; (plot
;;   (-> penguins
;;       (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
;;       (scatter)))
;; ```
;;
;; **When to use `plot` explicitly**:
;; - Debugging: Inspect the Plotly.js/Vega-Lite/SVG spec
;; - Customization: Post-process the spec with target-specific features
;; - Extension: Add features not yet supported by the layer API
;;
;; **When to use `kind/pprint`**:
;; - Inspect the raw layer specification (`:aog/*` keys)
;; - Understand how composition merges layers
;; - Debug layer construction before rendering

;; ## ⚙️ Helper Functions

(defn- layers?

  Layers have :aog/* namespaced keys, while data vectors contain plain maps."

(defn plot
  "Unified rendering function supporting multiple targets.

  Most users should rely on auto-display and never call this directly.

  Use `plot` explicitly when you need:
  - Custom width/height options
  - Access to the raw target specification for debugging or customization

  Args:
  - layers: Vector of layer maps or single layer map
  - opts: Optional map with:
    - :width - Width in pixels (default 600)

  The rendering target is determined by:
  1. `:aog/target` key in layers (set via `target` function)
  2. :geom (static SVG) as default

  Returns:
  - Kindly-wrapped visualization specification

  ;; Get raw spec for customization:
  (plot layers {:width 800 :height 600})

  rendering system to call `plot` automatically when displaying the value.

  This enables the compositional workflow where layer specs auto-display.

  The `*`, `+`, and `facet` operators automatically apply this annotation to their
  return values, so most users never call this function directly.

  Args:
  - layers: Vector of layer maps (with :aog/* keys)

       [result])))

   (* layers (scatter attrs))))

;; ## 🧪 Examples

;; ## 🧪 Example 1: Simple Scatter Plot (Delegated Domain)

(* (data penguins)
   (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
   (scatter))

(kind/test-last [#(and (vector? %)
                       (map? (first %))
                       (contains? (first %) :aog/data)
                       (contains? (first %) :aog/x)
                       (contains? (first %) :aog/y)
                       (contains? (first %) :aog/plottype)
                       (= (:aog/plottype (first %)) :scatter)
                       ;; Also test that it renders to valid HTML
                       (let [rendered (plot %)]
                         (and (map? (meta rendered))
                              (= (:kindly/kind (meta rendered)) :kind/html))))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. We create layer spec with data, mapping, plottype
;; 2. The `*` operator returns layers annotated to auto-display as a plot
;; 3. We DON'T compute X/Y domains
;; 4. Rendering target receives data and computes domain itself
;; 5. This is simpler - we delegate what rendering targets do well.

;; **Inspecting the raw layer specification**:
(kind/pprint
 (* (data penguins)
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)))

;; Notice the `:aog/data`, `:aog/x`, `:aog/y`, `:aog/plottype` keys.
;; This is the compositional layer specification before rendering.

;; ## 🧪 Example 2: Plain Clojure Data Structures

;; The API works with plain Clojure data structures, not just datasets.
;; Two formats are supported:

;; **Map of vectors** (most common for columnar data):
(* (data {:x [1 2 3 4 5]
          :y [2 4 6 8 10]})
   (mapping :x :y)
   (scatter))

(kind/test-last [#(and (vector? %)
                       (= (:aog/x (first %)) :x)
                       (= (:aog/y (first %)) :y)
                       (map? (:aog/data (first %))))])

;; **Vector of maps** (row-oriented data):
(* (data [{:x 1 :y 2}
          {:x 2 :y 4}
          {:x 3 :y 6}
          {:x 4 :y 8}
          {:x 5 :y 10}])
   (mapping :x :y)
   (scatter))

(kind/test-last [#(and (vector? %)
                       (= (:aog/x (first %)) :x)
                       (= (:aog/y (first %)) :y))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Plain Clojure data (no tech.ml.dataset required)
;; 2. Both formats convert seamlessly to datasets internally
;; 3. Type inference works by examining values
;; 4. Helpful errors if data format is invalid

;; This is useful for quick exploration or when working with simple data
;; that doesn't need the full power of tech.ml.dataset.

;; ## 🧪 Example 2b: Threading-Macro Style
;;
;; All the API functions support Clojure's threading macro (`->`), providing
;; a more natural, pipeline-style syntax. This is especially useful for complex
;; visualizations where you're building up layers incrementally.

;; **Simple scatter plot**:
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter))

(kind/test-last [#(and (vector? %)
                       (= (:aog/x (first %)) :bill-length-mm)
                       (= (:aog/y (first %)) :bill-depth-mm)
                       (= (:aog/plottype (first %)) :scatter))])

;; **With color aesthetic**:
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})
    (scatter))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (:aog/color (first %)) :species)
                       (= (:aog/x (first %)) :bill-length-mm))])

;; **Combining scale customization**:
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (scale :x {:domain [30 65]})
    (scale :y {:domain [12 23]}))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (get-in (first %) [:aog/scale-x :domain]) [30 65])
                       (= (get-in (first %) [:aog/scale-y :domain]) [12 23]))])

;; **Works with plain data too**:
(-> {:x [1 2 3 4 5]
     :y [2 4 6 8 10]}
    (mapping :x :y)
    (scatter))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (:aog/x (first %)) :x)
                       (= (:aog/plottype (first %)) :scatter))])

;; **What's happening under the hood**:
;;
;; 1. Each function detects whether its first argument is layers (vector with `:aog/*` keys)
;;    or data (dataset, map-of-vectors, vector-of-maps)
;; 2. If data: converts to layers first via `(data ...)`
;; 3. If layers: merges the new specification using `*`
;; 4. Everything returns vectors, so threading works naturally
;;
;; **Both styles work**:
;;
;; You can use compositional style with `*`:
;; ```clojure
;; (* (data penguins) (mapping :x :y) (scatter))
;; ```
;;
;; Or threading style with `->`:
;; ```clojure
;; (-> penguins (mapping :x :y) (scatter))
;; ```
;;
;; They produce identical results. Choose whichever feels more natural for your use case.

;; ## 🧪 Example 3: Type Information in Action

;; Now let's see how we can use Tablecloth's type information.
;; We get types for free, no complex inference needed.

;; Note: infer-from-values is defined above with other type helpers

(defn infer-scale-type
  "Infer scale type from values in a layer."
  [layer aesthetic]
  (let [data (:aog/data layer)
        dataset (ensure-dataset data)
        col-key (get layer (keyword "aog" (name aesthetic)))
        values (when col-key (tc/column dataset col-key))]
    (cond
      (nil? values) nil
      (every? number? values) :continuous
      (some #(instance? java.time.temporal.Temporal %) values) :temporal
      :else :categorical)))

(let [layer (* (data penguins)
               (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})
               (scatter))
      layer (first layer)]
  {:x-type (infer-scale-type layer :aog/x)
   :y-type (infer-scale-type layer :aog/y)
   :color-type (infer-scale-type layer :aog/color)})

;; Notice: Type inference is instant (O(1) lookup from Tablecloth metadata),
;; not O(n) value examination.

;; ## 🧪 Examples

;; ### 🧪 Simple Histogram

;; Basic histogram showing distribution of bill lengths:

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)
    (histogram))

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. We map only `:bill-length-mm` to x (no y mapping for histograms)
;; 2. Histogram transform bins the data using Sturges' rule
;; 3. We compute: domain → bin edges → bin counts
;; 4. Rendering target receives bars (bin ranges + heights), not raw points
;; 5. This shows why we can't fully delegate - we need domain before binning.

;; ### 🧪 Custom Bin Count

;; Try different binning methods:

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)
    (histogram {:bins 15}))

;; # 📊 Grouping & Color
;; 
;; Type-aware grouping: categorical colors create groups for statistical transforms.

;; ## 🧪 Example 5: Grouping with Categorical Color

;; When you map a **categorical** variable to color, it automatically creates groups
;; for statistical transforms. This matches AlgebraOfGraphics.jl and ggplot2 behavior.

;; **Categorical color → grouped regression**:
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})
    (+ (scatter {:alpha 0.5})
       (linear)))

(kind/test-last [#(and (vector? %)
                       (= (count %) 2)
                       (= (:aog/color (first %)) :species)
                       (= (:aog/transformation (second %)) :linear))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. `:species` is categorical (`:string` type in Tablecloth)
;; 2. System automatically groups by `:species` for the linear transform
;; 3. Computes 3 separate regression lines (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)
;; 4. Each group gets a different color from the ggplot2 palette
;; 5. Scatter points are also colored by species

;; **Categorical color → grouped histogram**:

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm nil {:color :species :alpha 0.7})
    (histogram))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (:aog/transformation (first %)) :histogram)
                       (= (:aog/color (first %)) :species)
                       (= (:aog/alpha (first %)) 0.7))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Creates 3 separate histograms (one per species)
;; 2. Each histogram uses the same binning method
;; 3. Bars are colored by species
;; 4. Alpha transparency (0.7) lets you see overlapping bars
;; 5. This is different from faceting - bars can overlap/stack

;; ## 🧪 Example 6: Continuous Color (No Grouping)

;; When you map a **continuous** variable to color, it creates a visual gradient
;; but does NOT create groups for statistical transforms.

;; **Continuous color → single regression with gradient**:
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :body-mass-g})
    (+ (scatter {:alpha 0.5})
       (linear)))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (count %) 2)
                       (= (:aog/color (first %)) :body-mass-g)
                       (= (:aog/transformation (second %)) :linear))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. `:body-mass-g` is continuous (`:int64` type in Tablecloth)
;; 2. System does NOT group by body mass
;; 3. Computes a single regression line across all points
;; 4. Scatter points are colored by body mass (continuous gradient)
;; 5. The regression line shows overall trend, ignoring color grouping

;; This is the key semantic difference:
;; - Categorical aesthetics → semantic grouping (affects computations)
;; - Continuous aesthetics → visual mapping only (no grouping)

;; ## 🧪 Example 7: Explicit Grouping Override

;; You can explicitly control grouping using the `:group` aesthetic.
;; This lets you group by one variable while coloring by another.

;; **Explicit :group aesthetic**:
(-> mtcars
    (mapping :wt :mpg {:group :cyl})
    (+ (scatter)
       (linear)))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (count %) 2)
                       (= (:aog/group (first %)) :cyl)
                       (= (:aog/transformation (second %)) :linear))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. `:cyl` (cylinders) could be treated as continuous (it's numeric)
;; 2. But we explicitly group by `:cyl` using `:group`
;; 3. Computes separate regression lines for 4, 6, and 8 cylinder cars
;; 4. No color mapping, so all points/lines use default color

;; **Group different from color**:
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :sex :group :species})
    (+ (scatter {:alpha 0.5})
       (linear)))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (:aog/color (first %)) :sex)
                       (= (:aog/group (first %)) :species)
                       (= (:aog/transformation (second %)) :linear))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Color by `:sex` (2 colors: male/female)
;; 2. Group by `:species` (3 regression lines: Adelie/Chinstrap/Gentoo)
;; 3. Points are colored by sex, but regressions computed per species
;; 4. This shows that grouping and color are independent concepts

;; ## 🧪 Example 8: Using `plot` for Spec Inspection and Customization

;; Most of the time, layers auto-display and you don't need `plot`.
;; But sometimes you want the raw target spec for debugging or customization.
;; See the Multi-Target Rendering section for examples of using `plot`
;; with :vl and :plotly targets.

;; # Faceting: Architectural Questions Revealed
;;
;; Implementing faceting has exposed several important design questions:
;;
;; ## 📖 1. Statistical Transforms Must Be Per-Facet
;;
;; **Example**: Histogram of bill-length faceted by species
;; - Semantically: User expects 3 separate histograms (one per species)
;; - Implementation: Must split data by `:species` BEFORE computing histograms
;; - Implication: Can't compute transforms before knowing about facets
;;
;; **Current architecture**: We apply transforms in `plot-impl` after extracting points
;; **Needed**: Apply transforms to each facet group separately
;;
;; ## 📖 2. Domain Computation: Shared vs Free Scales
;;
;; **Shared scales** (ggplot2 default):
;; - All facets use same x/y domain
;; - Pro: Easy to compare across facets
;; - Con: Facets with fewer observations may have compressed ranges
;;
;; **Free scales**:
;; - Each facet optimizes its own domain
;; - Pro: Each facet uses full visual range
;; - Con: Harder to compare magnitudes across facets
;;
;; **Decision**: Start with shared scales (simpler), add `:scales` option later
;;
;; ## 📖 3. Delegation Strategy: Control vs Leverage
;;
;; **Our principle**: We control semantics, targets handle presentation
;;
;; **What we control**:
;; - Data splitting by facet variable
;; - Per-facet transform computation
;; - Domain computation (shared or free)
;; - Color scale consistency
;;
;; **What targets can handle**:
;; - `:geom` - we compute layout positions manually
;; - `:vl`/`:plotly` - could use their grid layout features
;;
;; ## 📖 4. Rendering Architecture for :geom
;;
;; **Challenge**: thi.ng/geom-viz doesn't support multi-panel layouts
;;
;; **Needed**:

;; 1. Calculate panel dimensions (width / num-facets)
;; 2. Calculate panel positions (x-offsets)
;; 3. Create mini-plot for each facet at its position
;; 4. Add facet labels  
;; 5. Combine into single SVG
;;
;; **Complexity**: Significant refactoring of plot-impl :geom
;;
;; ## 📖 5. The Core Insight
;;
;; **Faceting reveals the same pattern as statistical transforms**:
;; - We MUST control the semantics (data splitting, per-group computation)
;; - But we CAN delegate presentation (layout, when targets support it)
;; - This validates our minimal delegation strategy
;;
;; **For statistical transforms + faceting**:
;; ```clojure
;; (plot (facet (* (data penguins)
;;                 (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)
;;                 (histogram))
;;              {:col :species}))
;; ```
;;
;; This requires:

;; 1. Split data by species (3 groups)
;; 2. Compute histogram for EACH group (per-facet transforms)
;; 3. Collect domains across all groups (shared scales)
;; 4. Render 3 mini-histograms side-by-side
;;
;; **This is our value proposition**: Compute on JVM, send summaries to browser.
;; With faceting, even more important!"

;; # Faceting Exploration
;;
;; Let's explore faceting to see what architectural questions emerge.

;; ## 📖 Faceting Design Decisions
;;
;; After prototyping, we've decided:
;;
;; 1. **We control semantics** - Split data, compute transforms per-facet, manage domains
;; 2. **Targets handle presentation** - Layout and rendering (when they can)
;; 3. **Shared scales by default** - All facets use same domain (easier comparison)
;; 4. **Statistical transforms per-facet** - Histogram by species = 3 separate histograms
;;
;; ## ⚙️ Implementation Strategy
;;
;; 1. `split-by-facets` - Groups data by facet variable(s)
;; 2. Apply transforms to each facet group separately
;; 3. Compute domains across all facets (for shared scales)
;; 4. Render each facet as mini-plot
;;
;; For :geom target - compute layout positions manually
;; For :vl/:plotly targets - could use their grid layout features

;; ## 🧪 Example 10: Simple Column Faceting
;;
;; Facet a scatter plot by species - this creates 3 side-by-side plots.
;; # 📊 Faceting
;; 
;; Small multiples: splitting data across rows and columns.

;; Test faceted scatter plot - 3 side-by-side plots
(facet (* (data penguins)
          (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
          (scatter))
       {:col :species})

(kind/test-last [#(= (:aog/col (first %)) :species)])

;; Faceted histogram - per-species histograms with shared scales:

(facet (-> penguins
           (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)
           (histogram))
       {:col :species})

;; ## 🧪 Example 11: Row Faceting
;;
;; Facet by rows creates vertically stacked panels

(facet (* (data penguins)
          (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
          (scatter))
       {:row :species})

(kind/test-last [#(= (:aog/row (first %)) :species)])

;; ## 🧪 Example 12: Row × Column Grid Faceting
;;
;; Create a 2D grid of facets.
;; This creates a 3×2 grid (3 islands × 2 sexes = 6 panels)

(facet (* (data penguins)
          (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
          (scatter))
       {:row :island :col :sex})

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (:aog/row (first %)) :island)
                       (= (:aog/col (first %)) :sex))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Data split by both `:island` (3 values) and `:sex` (2 values)
;; 2. Creates 3×2 = 6 panels in a grid
;; 3. Column labels at top, row labels on left (rotated)
;; 4. Shared scales across all panels for easy comparison
;; 5. Per-panel rendering with proper x and y offsets

;; ## 🧪 Example 12b: Multiple Grouping Columns (Color + Faceting)
;;
;; When you combine color grouping with faceting, statistical transforms
;; group by BOTH aesthetics. This example shows linear regression grouped
;; by species (color) AND island (facet column), computing separate
;; regressions for each (species × island) combination.

(facet (* (data penguins)
          (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})
          (+ (scatter {:alpha 0.5})
             (linear)))
       {:col :island})

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (count %) 2)
                       (= (:aog/col (first %)) :island)
                       (= (:aog/color (first %)) :species))])

;; **What happens here**:
;;
;; 1. Faceting by `:island` creates 3 panels (one per island)
;; 2. Color by `:species` creates 3 groups (one per species)
;; 3. Linear regression groups by BOTH: 3 species × 3 islands = 9 regressions
;; 4. Each panel shows 3 colored regression lines (one per species on that island)
;; 5. This demonstrates that `get-grouping-columns` returns `[:species :island]`
;;
;; **Implementation detail**: The `get-grouping-columns` function collects all
;; categorical aesthetics that create groups (:aog/color, :aog/col, :aog/row, :aog/group)
;; and returns a vector. Transforms then group by the combination of all these columns.

;; ## 🧪 Example 13: Custom Scale Domains
;;
;; Override auto-computed domains to control axis ranges

;; Force y-axis to start at 0
(* (data mtcars)
;; # 📊 Scale Customization
;; 
;; Custom scale domains for precise control over axis ranges.

   (mapping :wt :mpg)
   (scatter)
   (scale :y {:domain [0 40]}))

(kind/test-last [#(= (get-in (first %) [:aog/scale-y :domain]) [0 40])])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Y-axis forced to extend from 0 to 40 instead of auto-computed range from 10.4 to 33.9
;; 2. Useful for starting axes at meaningful values (like 0)
;; 3. Custom domains compose via `*` operator

;; Custom domains on both axes
(* (data penguins)
   (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
   (scatter)
   (scale :x {:domain [30 65]})
   (scale :y {:domain [10 25]}))

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Both axes use custom ranges
;; 2. Zooms into a specific region of the data
;; 3. Useful for focusing on areas of interest or ensuring consistent scales across multiple plots

;; # Multiple Rendering Targets
;;
;; One of the key benefits of our API design is **backend agnosticism**. The same
;; plot specification can be rendered by different visualization libraries.
;;
;; So far, all examples have used the `:geom` target (thi.ng/geom for static SVG),
;; which is the default. To select a different target, use the `target` function.

;; # 📊 Multi-Target Rendering
;; 
;; Same API, different backends: :geom (SVG), :vl (Vega-Lite), :plotly (Plotly.js).

;; ## 🧪 Examples

;; ## 🧪 Example 14: Simple Scatter with Vega-Lite

;; Use `target` to select the `:vl` target (Vega-Lite):

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (target :vl))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (:aog/target (first %)) :vl)
                       ;; Test that it renders to valid Vega-Lite spec
                       (let [rendered (plot %)]
                         (and (map? rendered)
                              (contains? rendered :data)
                              (contains? rendered :mark)
                              (contains? rendered :encoding))))])

;; **What's different**:

;; 1. Interactive tooltips on hover
;; 2. Vega-Lite's polished default styling
;; 3. Same data, same API, different rendering

;; ## 🧪 Example 15: Multi-Layer with Vega-Lite

;; Scatter + regression works too:

(-> mtcars
    (mapping :wt :mpg)
    (+ (scatter)
       (linear))
    (target :vl))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (count %) 2)
                       (= (:aog/target (first %)) :vl))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Scatter plot rendered as VL `point` mark
;; 2. Regression computed on JVM (our delegation strategy!)
;; 3. Fitted line sent to VL as `line` mark
;; 4. VL layers them together

;; ## 🧪 Example 16: Color Mapping with Vega-Lite

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})
    (+ (scatter)
       (linear))
    (target :vl))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (:aog/color (first %)) :species)
                       (= (:aog/target (first %)) :vl))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Color mapping becomes VL's color encoding
;; 2. VL provides interactive legend
;; 3. Regression computed per species (3 separate lines)
;; 4. Click legend to filter interactively.

;; **Histogram with Vega-Lite**:

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)
    (histogram)
    (target :vl))

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Histogram bins computed on JVM using fastmath
;; 2. Bar data sent to VL
;; 3. VL renders as bar chart
;; 4. Interactive tooltips show bin ranges and counts

;; ## 🧪 Example 17: Faceting with Vega-Lite

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (facet {:col :species})
    (target :vl))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (:aog/col (first %)) :species)
                       (= (:aog/target (first %)) :vl))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Our API detects faceting specification
;; 2. Delegates to VL's native column faceting
;; 3. VL handles layout and labels
;; 4. Each panel is independently interactive

;; ## 🧪 Example 19: Grid Faceting with Vega-Lite

;; Grid faceting with custom dimensions using compositional `size`:

(plot
 (-> penguins
     (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
     (scatter)
     (facet {:row :island :col :sex})
     (target :vl)
     (size 800 600)))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :spec)
                       (contains? % :facet)
                       (= (-> % :facet :row :field) "island")
                       (= (-> % :facet :column :field) "sex"))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. 2D grid faceting using VL's row × column faceting
;; 2. VL handles all layout computation
;; 3. Shared scales across all panels
;; 4. Interactive exploration across the grid

;; ## 🧪 Example 20: Custom Domains with Vega-Lite

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (scale :x {:domain [30 65]})
    (scale :y {:domain [10 25]})
    (target :vl))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (get-in (first %) [:aog/scale-x :domain]) [30 65])
                       (= (:aog/target (first %)) :vl))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Custom domains passed to VL's scale specification
;; 2. VL respects our domain constraints
;; 3. Same composition semantics across targets

;; ## 📖 The Power of Backend Agnosticism
;;
;; **Key insight**: Our flat map representation with `:aog/*` keys creates a
;; separation between plot semantics and rendering implementation.
;;
;; **What we control** (across all targets):
;; - Statistical transforms (regression, histogram)
;; - Data transformations
;; - Composition semantics
;;
;; **What targets handle** (differently):
;; - `:geom` - Static SVG, manual layout, ggplot2-like styling
;; - `:vl` - Interactive web viz, native faceting, Vega-Lite styling
;; - `:plotly` - Rich interactivity, 3D support (coming soon)
;;
;; This is the payoff of our design choices:
;; - Flat maps compose with standard library
;; - Minimal delegation keeps implementation focused
;; - Backend-agnostic IR enables multiple rendering strategies

;; # Plotly.js Target Examples
;;
;; Now let's explore the `:plotly` target, which provides interactivity
;; and is particularly strong for dashboards and web applications.

;; ## 🧪 Example 21: Simple Scatter with Plotly

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (target :plotly))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (:aog/target (first %)) :plotly)
                       ;; Test that it renders to valid Plotly spec
                       (let [rendered (plot %)]
                         (and (map? rendered)
                              (contains? rendered :data)
                              (contains? rendered :layout)
                              (sequential? (:data rendered)))))])

;; **What's different from :geom and :vl**:

;; 1. Hover tooltips showing exact x/y values
;; 2. Toolbar with zoom, pan, and download options
;; 3. Smooth animations and transitions
;; 4. Same ggplot2 theming (grey background, white grid)

;; ## 🧪 Example 22: Multi-Layer with Plotly

(-> mtcars
    (mapping :wt :mpg)
    (+ (scatter)
       (linear))
    (target :plotly))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (count %) 2)
                       (= (:aog/target (first %)) :plotly))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Scatter plot rendered as Plotly scatter trace
;; 2. Regression computed on JVM (our minimal delegation!)
;; 3. Both traces combined in single Plotly spec
;; 4. Interactive hover works for both layers

;; ## 🧪 Example 23: Color-Grouped Regression with Plotly

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})
    (+ (scatter)
       (linear))
    (target :plotly))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (:aog/color (first %)) :species)
                       (= (:aog/target (first %)) :plotly))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Three scatter traces (one per species) with ggplot2 colors
;; 2. Three regression lines (computed per-group on JVM)
;; 3. Matching colors for scatter points and regression lines
;; 4. Interactive legend - click to show/hide species
;; 5. Demonstrates full composability with color aesthetics

;; **Simple Histogram with Plotly**:

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)
    (histogram)
    (target :plotly)
    (size 500 400))

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Histogram computed on JVM using Sturges' rule
;; 2. Pre-computed bins sent to Plotly as bar trace
;; 3. White bar borders (ggplot2 theme)
;; 4. Hover shows bin range and count

;; **Faceted Histogram with Custom Bins (Plotly)**:

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm nil)
    (histogram {:bins 12})
    (facet {:col :species})
    (target :plotly)
    (size 900 350))

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Per-species histograms (computed on JVM)
;; 2. Faceted layout (3 columns)
;; 3. Shared y-axis for easy comparison
;; 4. Custom bin count (12 bins)
;; 5. Full interactivity with hover tooltips

;; ## 🧪 Example 24: Faceted Scatter with Plotly

(plot
 (-> penguins
     (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
     (scatter)
     (facet {:col :species})
     (target :plotly)
     (size 800 400)))

(kind/test-last [#(and (map? %)
                       (contains? % :data)
                       (contains? % :layout)
                       (sequential? (:data %))
                       (> (count (:data %)) 0))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Data split by species (3 facets)
;; 2. Each facet rendered in separate subplot
;; 3. Shared axes for easy comparison
;; 4. Species names as column headers
;; 5. Independent zoom/pan for each subplot

;; ## 🧪 Example 26: Custom Domains with Plotly

(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (scale :x {:domain [30 65]})
    (scale :y {:domain [10 25]})
    (target :plotly))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (get-in (first %) [:aog/scale-x :domain]) [30 65])
                       (= (:aog/target (first %)) :plotly))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. Custom domain constraints respected
;; 2. Zoom/pan constrained to specified ranges
;; 3. Same composition semantics across all targets

;; ## 🧪 Example 15: Compositional Size Specification

;; Width and height can be specified compositionally using the `size` constructor,
;; just like `target`. This enables full threading and keeps plot dimensions as
;; part of the layer specification.

;; **Using the `size` constructor**:
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
    (scatter)
    (facet {:row :island :col :sex})
    (target :vl)
    (size 800 600))

(kind/test-last [#(and (= (:aog/width (first %)) 800)
                       (= (:aog/height (first %)) 600)
                       (= (:aog/target (first %)) :vl))])

;; **Full threading with `plot`**:
;; The `plot` function also supports threading, so you can optionally call it
;; explicitly at the end of your pipeline (though auto-display usually handles this):
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})
    (scatter {:alpha 0.7})
    (target :plotly)
    (size 1000 500)
    (plot))

(kind/test-last [#(map? (meta %))])

;; **What happens here**:

;; 1. `size` merges `:aog/width` and `:aog/height` into layers
;; 2. `plot-impl` methods check layers first, then opts, then defaults
;; 3. Priority: `:aog/width` > `:width opts` > `default-plot-width`
;; 4. Fully compositional - size is part of the layer spec, not external config

;; **Backwards compatibility**:
;; The old pattern still works - `plot` with opts map:
(plot
 (-> penguins
     (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
     (scatter)
     (target :vl))
 {:width 800 :height 600})

(kind/test-last [#(map? (meta %))])

;; Both approaches work. The `size` constructor enables full threading and
;; treats dimensions as compositional layer properties.

;; # Design Discussion
;;
;; ## 📖 Plot-Level Properties in Layer Vectors
;;
;; ### The Tension
;;
;; Our current design uses a vector of layer maps as the intermediate representation:
;;
;; ```clojure
;; (-> penguins
;;     (mapping :x :y)
;;     (scatter)
;;     (target :vl)
;;     (size 800 600))
;; ;; => [{:aog/data ... :aog/x :x :aog/y :y :aog/plottype :scatter 
;; ;;      :aog/target :vl :aog/width 800 :aog/height 600}]
;; ```
;;
;; Notice that `:aog/target`, `:aog/width`, and `:aog/height` appear in every layer,
;; even though their meaning applies to **all layers together**, not individual layers.
;; These are plot-level properties, not layer-level properties.
;;
;; This creates a conceptual impurity: properties about "how to render the whole plot"
;; are stored alongside properties about "what data to show and how to transform it."
;;
;; ### Why This Happens
;;
;; It's a consequence of our choice to use **vectors of maps** as the IR:
;;
;; - The `*` operator merges maps: `(merge layer-a layer-b)`
;; - When we do `(* layers (target :vl))`, the target gets merged into all layers
;; - Same for `(* layers (size 800 600))` - dimensions merge into every layer
;;
;; The current workaround: `plot-impl` extracts the first occurrence:
;; ```clojure
;; (some :aog/target layers-vec)  ;; Get first non-nil target
;; (some :aog/width layers-vec)   ;; Get first non-nil width
;; ```
;;
;; ### Alternative Approaches Considered
;;
;; **1. Metadata on the Vector**
;;
;; ```clojure
;; (defn target [target-kw]
;;   (with-meta [] {:aog/target target-kw}))
;;
;; ;; Result:
;; ^{:aog/target :vl :aog/width 800 :aog/height 600}
;; [{:aog/data ... :aog/x :x :aog/plottype :scatter}]
;; ```
;;
;; **Pros**: Conceptually clean separation - layers are grammar, metadata is rendering config
;;
;; **Cons**: Metadata easily lost, less inspectable, threading needs special handling
;;
;; **2. Wrapper Map**
;;
;; ```clojure
;; {:layers [{:aog/data ... :aog/x :x}
;;           {:aog/transformation :linear}]
;;  :config {:target :vl :width 800 :height 600}}
;; ```
;;
;; **Pros**: Explicit separation, no duplication, easy to inspect
;;
;; **Cons**: Breaks the algebra (`*` and `+` work on vectors), operators become complex
;;
;; **3. Special Marker Layer**
;;
;; ```clojure
;; [{:aog/data ... :aog/x :x :aog/plottype :scatter}
;;  {:aog/plot-config true
;;   :aog/target :vl :aog/width 800 :aog/height 600}]
;; ```
;;
;; **Pros**: Keeps vector structure, filterable
;;
;; **Cons**: Still mixed concerns, just specially marked
;;
;; **4. Accept the Duplication (Current)**
;;
;; Keep plot-level properties duplicated in every layer.
;;
;; **Pros**: Simple, works with current algebra, extraction via `some` is straightforward
;;
;; **Cons**: Conceptually impure, wasteful (though negligible), could confuse on inspection
;;
;; ### Current Decision
;;
;; We've chosen **Alternative 4** (accept duplication) for now because:
;;
;; 1. **Simplicity**: No special cases in `*` and `+` operators
;; 2. **Works**: The `some` extraction pattern is fast and reliable
;; 3. **Practical**: The duplication overhead is negligible in practice
;; 4. **Revisable**: If this becomes problematic, we can migrate to metadata later
;;
;; The key insight: this is a **limitation of using vectors of maps as IR**, not a
;; fundamental flaw. If plot-level configuration grows significantly, the metadata
;; approach (Alternative 1) would be the natural evolution, as it mirrors Clojure's
;; philosophy of metadata for "information about the thing" vs "the thing itself."
;;
;; For now, the simplicity trade-off is worth it.

;; # Summary
;;
;; ## 📖 What We've Explored
;;
;; This notebook demonstrates a composable graphics API with **minimal delegation**:
;;
;; **Core Design**:
;; - Layers as flat maps with `:aog/*` namespaced keys
;; - Composition using `*` (merge) and `+` (overlay)
;; - Standard library operations work natively
;; - Backend-agnostic IR
;;
;; **Delegation Strategy**:

;; 1. ✅ **We compute**: Statistical transforms, domains (when needed), types (from Tablecloth)
;; 2. ❌ **We delegate**: Axis rendering, ranges, ticks, "nice numbers", layout
;;
;; **Key Wins**:
;; - Type information from Tablecloth (free!)
;; - Domain computation only for statistical transforms
;; - Leverage rendering target polish for rendering
;; - Simple, focused implementation

;; # 🧪 Validation Examples
;;
;; The Malli schemas enable validation at two points:
;; - Construction time (opt-in, via *validate-on-construction*)
;; - Draw time (default-on, via *validate-on-draw*)

;; ## Example 1: Valid Layer

;; A properly constructed layer passes validation silently
(validate Layer
          {:aog/data {:x [1 2 3] :y [4 5 6]}
           :aog/x :x
           :aog/y :y
           :aog/plottype :scatter
           :aog/alpha 0.7})

;; ## Example 2: Invalid Alpha (Out of Range)

;; Alpha must be between 0.0 and 1.0
(validate Layer
          {:aog/data {:x [1 2 3]}
           :aog/plottype :scatter
           :aog/alpha 1.5})

;; ## Example 3: Invalid Plot Type

;; Plot type must be one of the defined enums
(validate Layer
          {:aog/data {:x [1 2 3]}
           :aog/plottype :invalid-type})

;; ## Example 4: Missing Required Aesthetics

;; Scatter plots require both x and y
(validate-layer
 {:aog/data {:x [1 2 3] :y [4 5 6]}
  :aog/x :x
  ;; Missing :aog/y!
  :aog/plottype :scatter})

;; ## Example 5: Missing Column in Dataset

;; Column references must exist in the data
(validate-layer
 {:aog/data {:x [1 2 3]}
  :aog/x :x
  :aog/y :y ;; y column doesn't exist!
  :aog/plottype :scatter})

;; ## Example 6: Construction-Time Validation

;; Enable validation during layer construction for immediate feedback
;; This will throw immediately when scatter is called
(try
  (binding [*validate-on-construction* true]
    (-> penguins
        (mapping :invalid-column :bill-depth-mm)
        (scatter {:alpha 1.5})))
  (catch Exception e
    {:error (ex-message e)
     :data (ex-data e)}))

;; ## Example 7: Draw-Time Validation (Default)

;; By default, validation happens when plot is called
;; This catches errors before attempting to render
(try
  (plot [{:aog/data penguins
          :aog/x :bill-length-mm
          :aog/y :invalid-column
          :aog/plottype :scatter}])
  (catch Exception e
    {:error (ex-message e)
     :data (ex-data e)}))

;; ## Example 8: Disabling Draw-Time Validation

;; Sometimes useful for debugging or performance
;; Not recommended! Validation is skipped, errors occur later with less helpful messages
(try
  (binding [*validate-on-draw* false]
    (plot [{:aog/data penguins
            :aog/x :bill-length-mm
            :aog/y :invalid-column
            :aog/plottype :scatter}]))
  (catch Exception e
    {:error (ex-message e)
     :data (ex-data e)}))

;; ## Example 9: Programmatic Validation

;; Check validity without throwing
(valid? Layer {:aog/data {:x [1 2 3]} :aog/plottype :scatter})

(valid? Layer {:aog/plottype :invalid})

;; Get detailed error information
(validate Layer {:aog/plottype :invalid :aog/alpha 2.0})

;; ## Example 10: Validation in Practice

;; Recommended pattern: construct freely, validate at render time
(-> penguins
    (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm {:color :species})
    (scatter {:alpha 0.6})
    (plot))

;; For development, enable construction-time validation to catch errors early
(binding [*validate-on-construction* true]
  (-> penguins
      (mapping :bill-length-mm :bill-depth-mm)
      (scatter {:alpha 0.6})
      (linear)
      (plot)))
